## Suggested Usage & Fair-Use Limits (publish in FAQ + Terms)

Use soft limits to protect infra while keeping pricing simple:

- Free Forever:
  - 1 account
  - comment auto-replies only
  - no DM automation
- Starter / Starter + AI:
  - 1 account
  - suitable for up to ~5,000 DM sends/month
- Growth / Growth + AI:
  - up to 4 accounts
  - suitable for up to ~40,000 DM sends/month total
- AI plans include monthly AI credits; overage billed separately.

## Overage Model (recommended)

Keep base plans attractive and monetize heavy usage cleanly:

- DM overage: pay-per-1,000 DM sends beyond fair-use guidance.
- AI overage: pay-per-1,000 AI actions beyond included credits.

## Positioning Copy for "Unlimited" Questions

Use this exact style:

"We do not hard-cap your growth on paid plans. Delivery remains subject to Meta policy windows, account quality limits, and fair-use safeguards to protect platform health."
