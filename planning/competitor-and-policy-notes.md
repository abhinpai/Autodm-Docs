# Competitor and Platform Policy Notes

## Positioning Context

Target: build a competitor to tools like Manychat and Superprofile for Instagram comment-to-DM automation workflows.

## "Unlimited DMs" Interpretation

1. Competitors may market plan-level unlimited messaging.
2. Platform-level constraints from Meta still apply (window/policy/rate behavior).
3. Product messaging should avoid implying bypass of platform policy controls.

## Superprofile Pricing Claim Context

1. Public pricing may present "unlimited" messaging at plan level.
2. This generally means no tool-imposed hard quota on that plan tier.
3. It does not mean Meta platform controls disappear.

## Meta Constraint Reality

1. Messaging-window restrictions and policy checks still apply.
2. Delivery can fail for policy reasons even when platform plan says \"unlimited\".
3. Reliability depends on pacing, retries, and compliant flow design.

## Safe Product Messaging Recommendation

Use language such as:

1. "No app-level DM cap on this plan" (if true for your product).
2. "Subject to Instagram/Meta platform policies and delivery constraints."

## Product-Safe Positioning

1. Emphasize reliability and compliance.
2. Emphasize campaign intelligence (context-aware matching, AI fallback).
3. Emphasize conversion analytics and rule quality.

## Lead Magnet Definition

A lead magnet is a useful free asset offered to users in exchange for action/engagement.

Examples:

1. itinerary links
2. PDF guides/checklists
3. templates
4. discount/offer links
5. booking/call links

## How It Maps to Product

1. Comment trigger -> contextual DM delivery.
2. Follow-up CTA -> intent confirmation or conversion path.
3. Analytics -> lead quality and campaign ROI measurement.
