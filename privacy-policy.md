# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 15, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how AutoDM-Test ("we", "our", "us") collects, uses, and protects information when using our Instagram comment monitoring and auto-reply service.

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to the AutoDM-Test service that:

- receives Instagram webhook events;
- checks comments for configured keywords; and
- sends automated private replies through Meta Graph API based on those keywords.

## 2. Information We Process

When our service receives webhook events, we may process:

- Instagram comment ID;
- comment text;
- commenter username;
- metadata provided by Meta webhook payloads;
- service logs needed for debugging and security.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data categories.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use processed information only to:

- detect configured trigger keywords in comments;
- send automated private replies via Meta APIs;
- prevent duplicate processing of the same comment;
- maintain security, monitor abuse, and troubleshoot errors.

## 4. Legal Basis and Permissions

Data processing occurs under permissions granted through Meta platform integrations and user/business authorization flows.

## 5. Data Sharing

We share data only with service providers required to operate the service, such as:

- Meta platform APIs;
- hosting, logging, and infrastructure providers.

We do not sell personal data.

## 6. Data Retention

Webhook event data and logs are retained only as long as needed for service operation, troubleshooting, legal obligations, and security monitoring.

## 7. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, including transport encryption, access controls, and secret management practices. No method of storage or transmission is completely secure.

## 8. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of your personal data.

## 9. Third-Party Platforms

Instagram and Meta platform usage is also subject to Meta's terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party platform practices.
