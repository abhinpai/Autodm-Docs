## Interpretation
1. Conservative path stays negative through year-1; this is expected if paid growth is slower and free usage is high.
2. Base path turns contribution-positive early and ends year-1 with healthy monthly surplus.
3. Aggressive path generates strong contribution because ARPU and scale absorb fixed costs quickly.

## Levers that change outcome fastest
1. Increase conversion from Free -> Starter/Starter+AI (biggest impact).
2. Control AI credit caps and enforce overage billing (protect margins).
3. Keep free tier strict (comment-only, no DM sends) to reduce free-user infra load.
4. Push annual plans (15-20% discount) to improve cash flow and retention.
